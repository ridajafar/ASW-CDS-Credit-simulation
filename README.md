# ASW-CDS-Credit-simulation

"This repository presents a set of financial exercises and case studies that cover various aspects of financial modeling and analysis. Here's an overview of the included content:

1. **Exercise: Asset Swap**
   - Calculate the Asset Swap Spread Over Euribor3m for an issuer (YY) based on a 3-year bond's price and coupon details, considering the discounting curve vs. Euribor 3m as of January 31, 2023.

2. **Case Study: CDS Bootstrap**
   - Explore CDS (Credit Default Swap) bootstrap techniques with specific values for discounts, recovery rate, and CDS spreads for the issuer ISP. Perform tasks such as building a complete set via spline, constructing piecewise constant λ(t), and examining the impact of the "accrual" term. Compare results with Jarrow-Turnbull approximation.

3. **Exercise: Credit Simulation**
   - Simulate default times (𝜏) based on provided survival probability equations over a 30-year period, with varying 𝜆 values (𝜆1, 𝜆2) and 𝜃.
   - Fit the survival probability distribution using a sample of M=105 points and provide estimators and confidence intervals (CI) for 𝜆1 and 𝜆2.
   
This repository serves as a practical resource for individuals interested in asset swaps, CDS bootstrapping, and credit risk simulation, offering hands-on exercises and case studies for financial analysis and learning."
